# Final Python Project – GIF Maker 🎞️

This is my beginner-level Python project from **Codedex**.

### 🧠 What I Learned:
- How to work with external libraries like `imageio.v3`
- Reading and writing image files
- Converting a sequence of `.png` images into an animated `.gif`

### ⚙️ Tech Used:
- Python 3
- `imageio.v3` for image handling
- Local image files from my phone

### 💡 Challenges:
- Handling unsupported image formats like `.HEIC` from iPhone
- Converting `.HEIC` to `.PNG` to make them compatible
- Understanding image frame durations for smooth playback

### 🖼️ Final Output:
A `.gif` file named `final_project.gif` generated using Python!
